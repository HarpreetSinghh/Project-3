Virtual robots are expected to gather treasures and sort the treasures based on a
set of user-defined criteria.

The programme should allow the user to select and place different types of treasure and there must be a number of hidden traps that are randomly generated within an arena, provide a breif discription for each treasures and assign each treasure with a score. With a starting point, wish list and time. The robot should start with the nearest treasure and gather as many tresures that are required on the list as possible in the given time. Every time the robot falls into the hidden trap it will lose some treasure. When the robot stops at a treasure that is on its wish list it will show the discription on screen of the tresure. The tresures should first be displayed in an unsorted order. The robot will then show how the treasure (according to score) are sorted in a animation using a sorting algorithim.
